# Backend Feature Matrix

This file is the required parity checklist for all backend engines. A feature is only considered complete when every supported engine on a platform implements the same request and response semantics.

Legend:

- `Required`: must be implemented for all engines on supported platforms
- `Capability-Gated`: UI may expose only when the target reports support
- `Desktop Only`: required on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- `Android`: required on Android engines

## Error and Reliability Requirements

Every engine must return typed error codes for:

- `auth_failed`
- `tls_error`
- `timeout`
- `throttled`
- `unsupported_feature`
- `invalid_config`
- `object_conflict`
- `partial_batch_failure`
- `engine_unavailable`
- `unknown`

Every engine must:

- Avoid unhandled process crashes for recoverable API failures
- Return structured partial-failure payloads for batch operations
- Provide progress events for long-running transfers and benchmark runs
- Respect cancellation requests from the UI shell
